          <p class="justificado mb-4">November 27, 2023 | Despite progress in raising awareness about animal welfare globally, animal abandonment remains a significant issue, with harsh consequences for pets left behind. Owning a pet comes with a moral and ethical commitment, yet many disregard this responsibility, leading to a widespread problem that goes beyond animal sufferingâ€”it often reflects a deeper connection to interpersonal violence and societal issues.</p>
          
          <p class="justificado mb-4">Abandonment often subjects animals to prolonged periods of hunger, thirst, and exposure to life-threatening conditions. The toll of animal abandonment extends beyond individual animals, impacting communities and placing a heavy burden on animal shelters and rescue organizations. Many of these organizations struggle to keep up with the high number of abandoned pets that require care and potential rehoming.</p>
          
          <p class="justificado mb-4">In Chihuahua, Mexico, the statistics are grim. Local reports indicate that at least 4,400 pets, primarily dogs and cats, die each year due to abandonment, traffic accidents, or euthanasia at the local Anti-Rabies Center. Heartbreakingly, only around 4% of these animals find a second chance through adoption. According to recent figures from 2022, this number has been rising, with a 20% increase recorded during the pandemic in 2020. Additionally, animal control teams capture between 15 to 20 stray dogs each year in certain neighborhoods where the population of abandoned animals has grown significantly.</p>

          <p class="justificado mb-4">Animal abandonment is an unacceptable practice that showcases a lack of responsibility and empathy. Society must address this issue by implementing stricter legal measures, awareness campaigns, and support programs for pet owners facing challenges. A proposal has been made to amend the Penal Code of the State of Chihuahua to include penalties for those who abandon animals under their care. The proposed changes to Article 366 Bis, Section IX, would establish punishments of six months to two years in prison and fines of one hundred to five hundred units of measure and update (UMA) for individuals found guilty of abandoning a pet in dangerous conditions.</p>

          <p class="justificado mb-4">Through a cultural shift and firm commitment to animal welfare, society can work towards eradicating abandonment and ensuring that every pet enjoys a safe and dignified life. The future of harmonious human-animal relationships depends on our ability to take responsible, ethical actions for those who cannot speak for themselves.</p>

          <p class="justificado mb-4">Animal abandonment can stem from various causes, including changes in owners' personal circumstances and a lack of understanding of the responsibility that pet ownership entails. Some individuals may feel overwhelmed by the demands of caring for an animal and choose abandonment instead of seeking alternative solutions. However, it is the duty of the community and the law to reinforce that abandoning animals is not an acceptable option and to promote solutions that foster responsible pet ownership.</p>
